            <h2> Characteristic of Crytocurrency</h2>
            <p> 1. Decentralization
                Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, typically powered by blockchain technology. This means no single authority (like a government or bank) controls them.
                2. Security
                Transactions are secured using cryptographic methods, making it highly resistant to hacking or fraud. Blockchain technology ensures transparency and immutability of data.
                3. Transparency
                Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public ledger (blockchain), allowing anyone to verify and audit transactions while maintaining user anonymity.</p>
