                <h2>Current Trends in Cryptocurrency</h2>
                <p>Explore the latest trends shaping the future of cryptocurrency.</p>
                
                <h3>Scalability Issues</h3>
                <p>Transaction Speed and Fees: Blockchain networks struggle to handle a large volume of transactions, leading to high fees and slow processing times. Solutions like Layer 2 scaling and off-chain channels are being explored.</p>
                
                <h3>Decentralization</h3>
                <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to a financial system built on blockchain technology that operates without traditional banks or intermediaries. It uses smart contracts on blockchain networks (mainly Ethereum) to provide services like lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest, all in a peer-to-peer manner.</p>
                
                <p>The key features of DeFi include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decentralization – No central authority controls the system.</li>
                    <li>Transparency – Transactions are recorded on a public blockchain.</li>
                    <li>Accessibility – Anyone with an internet connection can participate.</li>
                    <li>Smart Contracts – Automated agreements that execute transactions without intermediaries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h3>
                <p>NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain. They are used to represent ownership of digital items like art, collectibles, and even real-world assets. NFTs have gained significant attention for their potential to revolutionize digital ownership and verification.</p>
                
                <h3>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</h3>
                <p>CBDCs are digital forms of fiat currency issued by central banks. They aim to provide the benefits of digital currencies while maintaining central bank control over the monetary supply. CBDCs can enhance financial inclusion, improve payment systems, and reduce the reliance on cash.</p>
