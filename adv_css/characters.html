            <h2>Decentralization</h2>
            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>Transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, making them secure and transparent. 
                Each transaction is verified by a network of computers (nodes).</p>

            <p>Unlike traditional currencies controlled by governments and central banks, 
                most cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology. 
                No single entity (government or institution) has control over it.</p>

            <h2>Digital & Borderless</h2>
            <h3>Security & Encryption</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques for security. 
                Transactions are irreversible, meaning once confirmed, they cannot be changed.</p>
            <img src="images/bein-crypto2.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency vs. CBDCs">

            <p>Cryptocurrencies exist only in digital form and can be sent or received anywhere in the world. 
                No need for intermediaries like banks.</p>
